linter-spell-word-list\n\nHelper classes to assist in implementation of [linter-spell](https://atom.io/packages/linter-spell) dictionaries based on\nword lists.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo implement a dictionary which stores its word list in Atom's configuration\nfile use an implementation of `provideDictionary` like the following.\n\n```javascript\nprovideDictionary () {\n  let a = new ConfigWordList({\n    name: 'Plain Text',\n    keyPath: 'linter-spell.plainTextWords',\n    grammarScopes: [\n      'text.plain',\n      'text.plain.null-grammar'\n    ]\n  })\n  this.disposables.add(a)\n  return provideDictionary()\n}\n```\n\nTo store the word list elsewhere you will need to derive a class from `WordList`\nand implement `getWords` and `addWord` as shown below.\n\n```javascript\nclass MyWordList extends WordList {\n  constructor (options) {\n    super(options)\n    this.words = []\n  }\n\n  getWords (textEditor, languages) {\n    return this.words\n  }\n\n  addWord (textEditor, languages, word) {\n    this.words.push(word)\n  }\n}\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"yitzi","email":"twburton@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-10-27T19:27:41.238Z","created":"2016-08-28T15:33:38.338Z","0.1.0":"2016-08-28T15:33:38.338Z","0.2.0":"2016-08-28T17:55:14.202Z","0.3.0":"2016-08-28T18:24:07.777Z","0.3.1":"2016-08-28T18:30:05.264Z","0.4.0":"2016-08-29T16:06:24.097Z","0.4.1":"2016-10-27T19:27:41.238Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/yitzchak/linter-spell-word-list","keywords":["linter-spell"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/yitzchak/linter-spell-word-list.git"},"author":{"name":"Tarn
